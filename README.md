# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study-Hackathon-C67


Description
Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

Evaluation
Goal
It is your job to predict if a customer will churn, given the ~170 columns containing customer behavior, usage patterns, payment patterns, and other features that might be relevant. Your target variable is "churn_probability"

Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Classification Accuracy between the value of the predicted value and the actual value of churn for each of the customers.

Accuracy score formula

The public leaderboard is going to rank your submission against other users while the competition is active, however, once the competition is ended, the final ranks will be calculated on the private leaderboard.

Submission file format
The file should contain a header and have the following format (CSV):

id,churn_probability
70005,0.0
70006,1.0
70007,0.0
etc.
A sample file can be found attached in the Data section of this competition.
